Files:

- `Machine Learning Document.docx` which has the machine learning experiments and results.
- `Feature Importance` folder has each model with feature importance, it's produced from `notebooks/trials/3. Trial4.ipynb`
- `Correlation` folder has each model with feature importance, it's produced from `notebooks/trials/Descriptive Analysis.ipynb`.
- `predictions.xlsx` has the test data with the actual **logkPL** values with our models predictions, it's produced from `notebooks/trials/3. Trial4.ipynb`.
- `clusters.xlsx` has compounds with their followings clusters, it's produced from `notebooks/5. Clustering.ipynb`.
- `cluster_analysis.xlsx` has clusters with **logkPL** descriptive values, it's produced from `notebooks/5. Clustering.ipynb`.
- `compounds_clustering.html` has the visualization of compounds saved in html file, open the notebook in jupyter and just save it as html.
